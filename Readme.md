# Course Site

This site is based on my [jekyll-syllabus](https://github.com/oncomouse/jekyll-syllabus) project, which generates readable, mobile-friendly, single-page course syllabuses using Jekyll.

## Course Management

Use `rake course <course tag>` to create the YAML (in `_data/`) and Markdown (in `courses/<year>`) files for a new course syllabus.

Use `rake delete_course <course tag>` to remove a course syllabus.
