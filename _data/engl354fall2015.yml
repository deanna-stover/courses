  - title: What Is Rhetoric Now?
    start: 1
    description: |
      This unit considers a number of major works that span the century of rhetorical studies and all ask or answer the question: what is rhetoric?
  - title: "Information: Rhetoric as Transmission"
    start: 3
    description: |
      This unit explores the linguistic turn as a grounding for the revival of rhetoric in the 20th century. We begin by looking at key figures in this turn before exploring more fully rhetoricians engaged in producing theories in response to this turn. The unit wraps with Walter Ong's *Orality and Literacy*, which begins to lay the groundwork for what comes next.
  - title: "Noise: Rhetoric as Disruption"
    start: 7
    description: |
      This unit explores poststructural or postmodern rhetorical theory as a development of the response to the crisis in structuralism instantiated by Jacques Derrida's developent of deconstruction. Further, this unit explores the wider range of audiences, affects, and perspectives that the challenge of poststructuralism made possible.
  - title: "Stuff: Rhetoric as Force"
    start: 11
    description: |
      This final unit explores the turn to materiality in rhetorical theory at the end of the 20th century. As computers become the dominant medium for thought itself, what if everything isn't actually a text? This unit explores turns to the digital, the material, and the animal as we end by looking at the future of rhetorical theory.
