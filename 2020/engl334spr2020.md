# *Black God's Drum*, by P. Djèlí Clark
{:.page-header}

## Novel Background

* Published in 2018
* Nominated for Hugo and Nebula (loses to the sequel to the Martha Wells novella we're reading next)
* Published by Tor.com
	* Part of the recent renaissance in short-form SF (stories and novellas)
	* Perhaps 15 years ago, short SF was dying out in favor of novel publication
		* This was mostly due to the decline in magazine reading generally
		* Novel-centric nature of SF was a longer trend starting in the 1960s
	* Recently, the rise of smart phones and e-readers has rejuvenated the market
		* Many online-only SF journals are winning awards and seeing remarkable success
	* Similarly, Tor.com, which is a spin-off from Tor (an established SF publisher), was created as a novella-focused platform, primarily targeting Kindle readers
	* Additionally, as an under-published market, authors have had a lot of success
		* In the last three years, either 4 or 5 of the 6 nominees for both Hugo and Nebulla novella awards have been Tor.com publications
* This represents a growing trend in the shifting manner in which SF is published and consumed.

## Steampunk

* *Black God's Drum* is an example of "steampunk"
* Comparable to Afrofuturism and cyberpunk in that it is also a multimedia project
* Steampunk imagines an alternate 1880s future/present
	* Usually Victorian England
	* American West
* In which Victorian contraptions imagined in period SF (Zeppelins, steam-powered spider walking machines, etc.) and strange scientific theories actually work
* We could also say: it is a modern reimagining of futures using 1880s perspectives on art, style, and technology
	* So, people writing *War of the Worlds* fan fiction
* Also a big deal in art and design
	* Building steam-powered devices
	* Elaborate, fantastic outfits
	* Brass contraptions
	* Clock work devices
	* Lots of Goggles
	* The *Wikipedia* page for [Steampunk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steampunk) has a lot of good images of this stuff
* The term is first coined in 1987 by K.W. Jeter
	* reference to work he (*Moorlock Nights* (1979), *Infernal Devices* (1987)), James Blaylock (*Homunculus* (1986)), and Tim Powers (*The Anubis Gates* (1983)) were all doing at the time.
	* Was originally a tongue-in-cheek reference to cyberpunk: steam instead of computers
	* Why? Now? In the 1980s
		* Think of how mass-produced everything, even people, is in *Neuromancer*. Steampunk comes to celebrate the eccentric, the hand-made, and the unique: tinkerers, crafters.
	* Jeter acknowledges a lot of early references:
		* *Wild Wild West* (TV, 1965-6)
		* Michael Moorcock's *The Warlord of the Air* (1971)
		* Wells, Verne, and [Edisonades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edisonade) such as Edward Ellis's *The Steam-Man of the Prairies* (1886)
* Term becomes more legitimate when William Gibson and Bruce Sterling publish *The Difference Engine* (1990), which imagines a cyberpunk narrative set in an alternate Victorian London that has working digital computers thanks to Charles Babbage.
* Other Examples of Steampunk
	* Hayao Miyazaki, especially *Howl's Moving Castle* and *Kiki's Delivery Service*
	* Disney's *Treasure Planet* and *Atlantis*
	* Alan Moore's *League of Extraordinary Gentlemen*
	* Visual Design in *Doctor Who*
	* *Bioshock Infinite*
	* Guy Ritchie's *Sherlock Holmes* movies

## Alternate History

* *Black God's Drum* also imagines an alternate past, in which the history of the Caribbean is very different
* Speculation about the present or past, not the future
* Popularized by
	* Ward Moore's *Bring the Jubilee* (1953) in which the confederacy wins the US Civil War
	* Keith Laumer's *Worlds of Imperium* (1961)
	* Philip K. Dick's *The Man in the High Castle* (1962)
* Speculation about the nature of causality
* How is alternate history SF? How is it not?

## Afrofuturism, Steampunk, and Alternate History in *Black God's Drum*

* I'm interested in Clark's novella as Afro-retrofuturism
	* Building an alternate past from the experiences of the African diaspora
	* But also built on a particular Victorian imagination

## Themes

* Steampunk:
	* 7 ("The night in ... the Dead City")
	* 8 ("Better than ... for a Thieving Boss")
	* 8-9 ("I can count ... are to see")
	* 15 ("I change my route ... do without.")
		* Henry Mayhew's [*London Labour and the London Poor*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Labour_and_the_London_Poor) was an important sourcebook for early Steampunk
		* Described a variety of jobs the poor did in London
	* 17 ("Best watch ... on my skin")
		* Magic is often an element in steampunk narratives
		* Does this change the novel's SF qualities?
	* 35-6 ("Her right ... my business")
	* 70 ("Drapeto gas ... at the corner of her lips")
	* 95-6 ("He didn't ... slow and building")
* Climate:
	* 7-8 ("Les Grand Murs ... like a bowl")
	* 45 ("No one schupid ... shaking her head")
	* This novella does interesting things with the recent history of New Orleans, especially Katrina. How does that factor into Clark's novella?
* Oya
	* 10 ("When I open ... to mean.")
	* 16 ("Best watch where ... bumps on my skin")
	* 40 ("The captain's head ... eyes blazing.")
	* 47-8 ("I'm not one ... I answer")
* Civil War
	* 11-2 ("These men ... in New Orleans")
* Alternate History
	* 19 ("There's Prussians ... red uniforms")
	* 20 ("New Orleans ... open port")
	* 30-1 ("I used to ask ... would say.")
	* 43 ("If it's so powerful ... on your airship.")
	* 44-5 ("The captain nods ... was born")
* Afrofuturism
	* 31 ("In Haiti ... catch on")
	* 32 ("That last part ... go cold inside")
	* 36-7 ("The magic of those ... what that means")
	* 39 ("I'm half expecting ... one you hear about")
	* 100 ("We change ... your protection")
* Magic
	* 60 ("The captain ... to figure out")
	* 63 ("The captain looks ... odd.")
	* 86 ("So you got dem ... the folk magic")

## Conclusions

Clark's novella is interesting in that it imagines a future where Haiti is freed through the use of a combination of science and folk magic and in which New Orleans is a free port established after a slave revolt. Yet in certain ways the history of slavery that remains and has been technologized is even more horrifying given its continuation post-Civil-War. Why do this? Clark's alternate history is not so much wish-fulfillment as it is a survey of many aspects of African diasporic experience in America and the Caribbean. So in that way, Clark is repurposing Afrofuturist ideas in the context of Steampunk.

## Assignment Descriptions

These are intended as overviews of the general goals of each assignment. Longer hand-outs will be provided along with discussion of the assignments during class.

### Reading Responses (Modified Attendance)

Due to the cancellation of classes and the move to online only classes for March and April, instead of the remaining attendance grades, I ask you to submit one paragraph of writing each week on Friday before midnight detailing something you found important in the reading from the previous week.

These will be graded on a pass/fail basis and there will be no extensions.

### Short Papers 1-3

Over the course of the semester, you will be asked to write three (3) short (3-4 page) papers in response to course discussion and the readings we are doing in class.

Papers should be formatted using 12pt, Times New Roman font and double spaced with 1-inch margins.

#### Textual Paper

Pick a scene in one of the texts we have read for class. A scene could be a portion of a chapter (3-4 paragraphs) or a paragraph or even a single sentence, but not an entire story or novel chapter. Discuss the stylistic, thematic, and imagistic content of this scene, while also connecting these issues to larger themes within the novel.

This paper uses internal evidence only (or primarily). You will be quoting material from the section in question and then discussing the style, theme, or imagery of the passage as it relates to the larger theme of the work.

#### Research Paper

Choose one of the texts we have read in class. Conduct research into the publication and authoring history of the piece.

Questions to consider:

1. Where was the piece first published?
	* What is the history of that venue?
1. What else is interesting/important about the publication?
	* Was it later adapted into a novel?
	* Was it an early standalone publication?
	* Was it collected in a short story collection?
1. Was the work typical of the author?
	* Is it an exception because of quality? Topic?
	* What can you learn about how the author worked?
1. When the work was published, what else was happening in SF history?
1. What else was the author doing / working on?
1. Was the work published internationally? When?

You may ask other questions as you research, and you are not required to answer all of these questions (you may find that none of these are helpful).

This paper does not advance an argument per se, but will need a thesis that outlines what you plan to focus on. For instance, "this paper considers 'Black Destroyer' by A.E. van Vogt as a classic example of the kind of story John W. Campbell sought out at *Astounding*" would be perfectly fine as a thesis.

Cite your work using MLA 8 citation.

##### Accessing Library Resources Off Campus:

If you need to access library resources from off campus, you have two options, which both have advantages and disadvantages:

1. Use a VPN to access the TAMU network:
	* [Instructions](https://it.tamu.edu/services/network-and-internet-access/virtual-private-networks/virtual-private-network-vpn/)
1. Use EZProxy to access library resources:
	* ["What is EZProxy?"](http://askus.library.tamu.edu/faq/166882)
	* [Library Instructions](http://askus.library.tamu.edu/faq/50901)
	* ["Configure Google Scholar to access library resources"](http://askus.library.tamu.edu/faq/165955)
	* Use an EZProxy browser extension: [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ezproxy-redirect/gfhnhcbpnnnlefhobdnmhenofhfnnfhi?hl=en) or [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ezproxy-redirect-foxified/)

Personally, I use an EZProxy browser extension because I can never remember to connect to the VPN and I don't use a lot of other TAMU services from home. If you use a lot of other campus-only services, the VPN may be right for you (campus VPN is also good if you need to access anything A&M related on an unsecure connection, like coffee shop wi-fi).

#### Analysis Paper

Pick two works we have read in the class. Also pick a topic that both have in common (whether this topic is content-driven or stylistic) and discuss how the two works are similar and/or different based on their treatment. As an example, you could pick depictions of space travel in two works we have read and discuss how both authors treat this topic differently; you might conclude that there is a changing understanding of technology based on the passage of time between the two works you are considering.

This paper should demonstrate both outside research and thematic analysis, combining the aspects of both previous papers.
