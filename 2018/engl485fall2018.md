## Assignment Descriptions

### Weekly Discussion Prompts

Students are responsible for bringing at least one question, topic, quote, or other idea to use in initiating the conversation each week.

### Science Reporting Project

Translate a recent scientific paper into a popular format (newspaper, blog, video, etc) that careful explains the work, situates it within the context of the scientific conversation, and even-handedly speculates on the possible implications of the research and discoveries.

### Data Narrative

Find a data set (possibly from [Data.gov](http://data.gov)). Use that data set to tell a story about a place, group of people, or other phenomenon.

Possible examples:

* Use demographics data to tell the story of a neighborhood's gentrification
* Use historic rainfall data to track changing climate patterns in the American Southwest

Additionally, produce a short response paper detailing the limits of the data and how you navigated around them or worked with them to further tell your story.

### Data Visualization Project

Using one of the tools we have discussed, build a data visualization to accompany your narrative from the previous assignment.
