### Assignment Descriptions

#### Reading Journal

Each Friday (starting on the second Friday of class), you will post an at least 700 word commentary on *one* reading from the previous week to your online reading journal (in eCampus, under "Content"). In this entry, you will *briefly* summarize the argument of the piece on which you are commenting before launching into a discussion of what you see as significant about this argument, how it connects to other things you have read in class, how you might use this theory in your own writing, or apply the argument about persuasion to another example. In these entries, you are showing me that you understand the reading (or that you understand why you do not understand the reading) and that you have thought significantly (or struggled mightily) with the text. 

These journal entries do not so much document that you have read but that you have thought about what you have read.

For the week of the pitch presentations, please write your entry about one of your classmates' presentations.

#### Walter Ong Project

Walter Ong identifies three modes of communication in *Orality & Literacy*: the oral, the written, and the then-emergent digital. For this assignment, I want you to make an object that responds to and documents some aspect of your life (at A&M, in Texas, online, etc.) using a combination of these three methodologies. How would you incorporate Ong's ideas of the oral? the written? the digital? into an account of a place or a phenomenon or a thing with which you are familiar.

#### Prospectus

In anticipation of your final project, you will write a one page, single-spaced prospectus for your final paper. This prospectus will outline the basics of your argument, cover the major points you will hit in reaching it, and the sources you will be working with.

Grading for this project will be based on your effectiveness in matching the genre of the project proposal / prospectus, but I will be providing you with feedback on the content of the proposed paper.

#### Pitch Presentation

Based on feedback on your prospectus, you will assemble a presentation of a maximum of seven minutes (3 minutes of talking, 4 minutes of discussion) to present to your classmates during week 12 of the course. Your classmates will be able to provide you with feedback on your project as well as suggest hints for further thinking as you develop your argument.

#### Final Paper

For the final paper, pick some aspect of the history of rhetoric during the period of the class that you would like to know more about. Think about something, specifically, that you found controversial or open to resolution in the course readings. For your final paper, write a 10 page analysis of the state of this issue, and argue for a position you think resolves the issue or introduces some new dimension to consider.

This paper will require you to conduct research outside of the material we have read for class.
