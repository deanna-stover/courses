  description: 'This course introduces students to rhetoric in the 20th century. Specifically,
    we will be exploring two themes that inform the understanding of rhetoric during
    this period: the discovery of the unconscious and the belief that society is a
    system for exchanging messages. The unconscious describes a society dominated
    by primal impulses and subject to violent, erratic behavior. Systems thinking
    marks society as rational and manageable. The competition between these two ideas
    structures many of the conversations surrounding persuasion in the 20th century,
    a century marked by the sudden and pronounced return of the study of rhetoric
    and persuasion.

# Asking Good Discussion Questions

This is a list of tips for formulating good discussion questions as part of your rhetorical term presentation.

I have sourced this list from ["We Aren’t Here to Learn What We Already Know" by Kyla Wazana Tompkins](http://avidly.lareviewofbooks.org/2016/09/13/we-arent-here-to-learn-what-we-know-we-already-know/).

* Make your discussion question simple, straightforward and jargon-free.
* Proofread your questions so that you catch grammar and spelling mistakes.
* Make your questions open-ended, i.e. not answerable with fact or by direct and immediate reference to the text.
* Make sure your question doesn’t rely on information the rest of the class doesn’t have, OR give the class enough information and background to be able to engage the question. Make sure the question is answerable to start with, i.e., is not vague and does not rely on facts or assumptions not addressable within the confines of our class conversation.
* Make reference to the text with quotes or page numbers: direct the class to look at a relevant passage, read it together out loud, and drill down into the writing and sentence structure itself to get at the problem you are looking at.
* A good discussion question reframes some of the problems of the text and then tries to get at internal logical problems and paradoxes or to think through the consequences, implications and applications of the theory.
* As such, questions about “experience” or “responses” or “feelings” tend not to be helpful questions – try to step back from personal responses and instead focus on the intellectual shape of the ideas and argument.
* Often we are tempted to ask the “what about” question: e.g., what about the people who are excluded from this theory? Although not an unreasonable question, asked in this manner this is not really a sophisticated question because it doesn’t open up conversation. The only answer to “what about” is: they aren’t there. More productive is to ask: how do the exclusions at the heart of this work facilitate certain conclusions, problems or paradigms, what are these paradigms and what happens when we consider this theory in a broader context? What would this theory look like if re-written from a different point in history, different assumptions about political economy, etc.?
* t’s not the worst idea to make sure you have some thoughts about how to answer your questions before sending them on to your colleagues. However, sometimes you are just really stumped and need to work through this question with your classmates. That’s okay too.
* Which brings me to: it is often smart and productive to write a preamble to a question. That preamble might be a short intellectual history of your questions, it might contextualize the text you are working with, it might scaffold the question you want to ask by referring to other texts or many points in the same text.  Don’t make this preamble so long that no-one can excavate the original question, however. Also….
* If you can answer your question while you are writing it, you probably need to just state your point of view and move on to another, related, question.
* Sometimes you are stuck with an instinct, a hunch, a nagging feeling and a half-formed question and you simply can’t move forward without thinking about it out loud. Bring those seemingly half-formed thoughts to the class: we will figure the direction or shape of your question together.
* Finally: when you don’t get it, you don’t get it. Ask for help from the professor or your classmates, and feel free and supported in bringing your “I Don’t Get It” questions to class. We will all profit from these acts of intellectual humility and generosity.

## Assignment Descriptions

### Rhetorical Term Presentation

Once during the semester, you will be required to deliver a presentation on a key term in rhetorical theory. The [list of terms can be viewed here](terms.html).  During this presentation, you will:

* Define the term
* Discuss it's history
* Provide at least two examples of its usage in:
	* Political Speech
	* TV Advertising
	* Popular Culture
	* Nonfiction Writing
	* Journalism
* Discuss contemporary applications of the term
* [Ask the class a question for discussion about the term](questions.html)
* Provide a list of five (5) scholarly sources that discuss the term

I have placed *A Handlist of Rhetorical Terms* and *Soucebook on Rhetoric* on reserve at Evans Library (in the Annex, on the Fourth Floor) as starting places (they are the standard references in the field). Additionally, Wikipedia may be a useful starting point.

We will do one presentation per class, at the beginning of class. I will circulate a sign-up sheet and you may sign up for topics on a first come, first served basis.

**You must be present on the day of your presentation to get credit for this assignment**.

You will need to provide me with your list of citations and your slides at least an hour before class.

Finally, before the class meeting following your presentation, you will need to post a blog entry to our class blog with the definition of your term and your five sources. This blog will serve as our course reference for rhetorical theory.

### Paper Proposal

Write a one page overview of the argument of your final paper. State the thesis near the beginning of the document, summarize your argument, reference any scholarly disputes you resolve or sources you cite, and mention important ideas you will be using in your paper. This proposal must *summarize* your argument while also saying *why* your argument is important or interesting.

For the **rhetorical analysis** (see below), explain your choice of rhetorical text for analysis. Remember that in the 20th/21st century, a rhetorical text does not need to be text. It can be an image, a video, a "snap", a tweet, a meme, a game, etc. You will need to argue for the importance of this text's use of rhetoric as well as why it will sustain an eight page analysis of its rhetoric. You do not have to choose a framework at this stage, if you are not sure.

For the **rhetorical concept** (see below), discuss what term/theme you want to analyze and how you suspect you will approach it. What controversies have you found? Do you think someone or someones in our reading are missing an obvious part of their argument? Have you identified a repeating theme from a variety of texts or in our class discussion that you'd like to know more about? These are some of the questions you can answer (but don't have to answer any more than one) in your proposal. You do not have to be specific as to the nature of your argument, but do give me a sense of both how you plan to proceed and why.

In both cases, the purpose of the proposal is to explain to me what you want to work on. This lets me provide you with feedback and to make sure that you are on the right track.

**In both cases, you are not bound to write about the topic you propose for your final paper, should your interests change.**

### Annotated Bibliography

As you start to focus on a final paper topic, this assignment asks you to find five (5) scholarly sources related to your paper topic (see below), document them in MLA standard bibliography format, and provide a one (1) paragraph summary of each citation.

### Final Paper

For the final paper, you have two options. Choose to either:

1. Perform a Rhetorical Analysis on a Text of Your Choosing
1. Discuss a Theme in or Analyze the History of a Rhetorical Concept

#### Rhetorical Analysis

We have discussed a number of methods for rhetorical analysis in this class:

1. Rhetorical Triangle Reading (Ethos/Pathos/Logos)
1. Pentadic Analysis
1. Metaphoric Analysis
1. Tropological Reading
1. Ideological Critique
1. Situational Analysis

Use one of the frameworks above to discuss a single piece (or set of related pieces) of rhetorical performance. Remember that you do not have to just use written text. Videos, games, tweets, snaps, images, Vines, etc. all also use rhetoric. The only challenge in selecting a text or texts for analysis is that they must be specific enough to avoid generalization but also broad enough to sustain eight pages of writing.

#### Rhetorical Concept

In the rhetorical term presentations, you have been generating a bank of rhetorical terms. For the final paper, you may choose to discuss one of these concepts in a particular domain. For instance, how does invention function on the Internet? Or, what is epideictic rhetoric today? Additionally, you may notice that several texts we have read (or you have read on your own) are discussing myth or dreams or democracy or propaganda (or some other term) in interesting and related ways. In both cases, you have identified something *interesting* in the rhetorical discourse. Your task in this assignment is to amplify this similarity *or* to answer your question by using outside sources to address your topic and enhance your ethos. In addition to supporting your claims with research, you need to say *why* what you have noticed is important or you need to answer the question yourself. In essence, this paper asks you to identify a research question or topic and figure out the ramifications of it for yourself.
